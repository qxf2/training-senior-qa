        Unknown to you, we exercised several good habits. Here are some:
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Tech:</strong> Installing Chrome Driver, setting an environment variable</li>
        <li><strong>Mindset:</strong> Technical issues arise everywhere and you have a lot of online help</li>
        <li><strong>Habits:</strong> Paying attention to what you feel before starting a new task and after completing a
            new
            task, retrospecting</li>
    </ol>
