    Verify your setup
</h3>

<p class="text-justify">After you are done with the exercise listed above, it is time to verify your ChromeDriver
    installation. It is a good habit
    to take small steps and verify them immediately. This will help you avoid getting stuck later on. To verify your
    setup, pull up your terminal prompt and type chromedriver. You should see the version you installed along with
    message as "starting.."
