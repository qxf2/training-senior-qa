    Before you begin
</h3>
<p>We would like to remind you of a few things:
<ol>
    <li>It is OK to run into issues during this step. Setup issues are a part of regular work.</li>
    <li>It is OK to not know what you are doing. Things will come together later in the course.</li>
</ol>

    Take a moment
</h3>
<p>Until you have the momentum of several small technical accomplishments, take a moment to figure out how you are
    feeling. This exercise will help you combat some unrealistic defense mechanisms at a later date!</p>
