<p class="text-justify">Welcome to Qxf2 Trainer - this screen is the start of your journey towards becoming a more
    technical tester. This training program has been created by testers for other testers. We have made many tweaks to
    our training program to incease the odds that you actually stick to this program.
    <br><br>

<h3 class="thin-text"><img src="https://qxf2.com/assets/img/setup_icon.png" width="60" height="60"> SETUP</h3>
<p class="text-justify">There are many other nice features to our program that you will discover as you work through our
    exercises. But before you begin, please follow all the instructions in the setup section of this page. Don't be
    scared if you have tried previously and failed. We wrote the setup guides assuming things would go wrong and that
    you would need help troubleshooting problems.
    <br><br>In this section, you will be guided to setup your environment. Proceed in order. Click on the first
    link/task that you are yet to complete.</p>

<h3 class="thin-text"><img src="https://qxf2.com/assets/img/exercises_icon.png" width="60" height="60"> EXERCISES</h3>
<p class="text-justify">We have tried our best to keep these exercises relevant and creative. Unlike most courses, we
    will not steadily build up your theoretical knowledge and then give you a practical problem. Instead, we will
    steadily present you with practical (and useful!) problems and hope that your theoretical knowledge increases with
    practice. For example, we won't teach you Python from scratch but will give you enough help to modify Python code
    based on patterns you observe.</p>
