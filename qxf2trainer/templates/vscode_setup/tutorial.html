<p class="text-justify">We expect this exercise to take you somewhere between 15-minutes to 2 hours. If you take more
    than two hours, please post what you tried along wtih error messages to our skpye channel.</p>

<p class="text-justify">In keeping with our attempt to help you think in different ways, we have listed three approaches
    that work. There is no shame or pride in choosing anyone of them. Just choose the method you are comfortable with
    and proceed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <img src="https://qxf2.com/assets/img/approach_icon.png" width="60" height="60"> Approach 1: Try it out yourself
</h3>
<ol>
    <li>We'd like to promote independent thinking and problem solving. So if you feel ready, try to install Visual
        Studio Code for Python without referring to any documentation, go for it!</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="thin-text">
    <img src="https://qxf2.com/assets/img/approach_icon.png" width="60" height="60"> Approach 2: Google for instructions
</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Google for Visual Studio Code for Python install 'your operating system name'
    </li>
    <li>Follow the instructions</li>
</ol>

<ol>
    <li>Visit <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">https://code.visualstudio.com/download</a> to install
        Visual Studio Code for your operating system</li>

</h3>
<p class="text-justify">Once you are done, create a new file using Visual Studio Code, write <span class="cmdline">print
        "Hello my name is YOUR_NAME"</span> in it and save the file. Make sure there are no spaces in front of the 'p'
    of print. Give it a name <span class="cmdline">my_first_step.py</span>. Now figure out how to execute the file using
    Visual Studio Code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="thin-text">

</h3>

<p class="text-justify">After you are done with the exercise listed above, try writing down what you just acheived in
    2-3 sentences. Recapping and verbalizing what you just did is an under-rated skill when you are learning something
    new. So don't skip this step! By the way, if you are new to coding, you took what looks like one small step for a
    programmer but it was (to paraphrase the famous Moon quote) a giant leap for you!
